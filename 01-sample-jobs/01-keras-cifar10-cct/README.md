### CCT Model for CIFAR-10 Classification

This application implements a Convolutional Contrastive Transformer (CCT) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It leverages the Keras library to define and train a deep learning model that combines convolutional layers and transformer architecture for enhanced performance in image classification tasks.
